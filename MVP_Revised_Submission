## 1. One-Sentence Pitch of Your Application  
A dynamic, customizable to-do list web app designed to boost productivity with personalized, sassy notifications that keep users on track — think Notion meets a motivational life coach with attitude.  

## 2. Problem Statement  
Traditional to-do lists often get abandoned, leaving tasks incomplete. This app combats task abandonment by making task management engaging, fun, and supportive with customizable, mood-based notifications to keep users motivated.  

## 3. Target Users  
Our primary audience includes productivity seekers, especially neurodivergent individuals who benefit from flexible, visually adaptable, and motivational task management.  

## 4. User Stories  

### **User Story 1: Customizable Task Views**  
- **As a neurodivergent user,**  
- I want to switch between bullet journal-style and kanban board views,  
- So that I can choose the format that best supports my thinking style.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Toggle between views with one click.  
- Tasks sync between views automatically.  
- Drag-and-drop functionality works in both views.  

### **User Story 2: Task Prioritization and Tagging**  
- **As a user,**  
- I want to color-code and tag tasks,  
- So that I can quickly identify priorities and group related tasks.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Users can assign custom colors and tags.  
- Kanban view groups tasks by color/tag.  
- Bullet journal view highlights priorities with unique markers.  

### **User Story 3: Focus Mode with Sensory-Friendly Design**  
- **As a neurodivergent user sensitive to clutter,**  
- I want a focus mode that simplifies the interface,  
- So I can concentrate without feeling overwhelmed.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Focus mode hides non-essential elements.  
- Background and task colors shift to low-contrast tones.  
- Notifications are muted or simplified in focus mode.  

### **User Story 4: Recurring and Rolling Tasks**  
- **As a user with executive function challenges,**  
- I want recurring tasks and unfinished tasks to roll over,  
- So I’m not discouraged by incomplete lists.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Users can mark tasks as recurring (daily, weekly, custom).  
- Incomplete tasks auto-carry to the next day.  
- Gentle reminders for rolled-over tasks without spam.
