# Week 1: MVP Proposal

### RG Team: Juliana, Mai, Steph, Thane, & Vanessa  


## 1\. One-sentence pitch of your application  
A streamlined to-do list web app that’s engaging, customizable, and increases productivity—kinda like Notion, but with sassy notifications to keep you on track\!  
## 2\. Problem statement: What issue does your application solve?  
To-do lists are often abandoned and tasks often go unchecked.  
This web app endeavors to encourage users to keep their tasks at top of mind by reminding them in customized  funny, sassy, engaging, endearing or urgent notification tones.  
## 3\. Target users: Who will use your application?   
People, including those who are neurodivergent, who seek to improve time management & task organization.  
## 4\. User Stories \- What types of users can we expect to use this to-do list app? 

### User Story 1: Customizable Task Views

**As a neurodivergent user**,

I want to be able to switch between a bullet journal-style list and a kanban board view,

So that I can choose the format that best suits my thinking and organizational style at any given time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* The user can toggle between bullet journal and kanban board views with one click.

* Tasks are automatically synced between views to avoid duplication.

* The user can reorder tasks in both views through drag-and-drop functionality.

### User Story 2: Task Prioritization and Tagging

**As a user**,

I want to color-code and tag my tasks,

So that I can easily identify high-priority tasks and group similar tasks together.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* The user can assign custom colors and tags to tasks.  
* The kanban board view groups tasks by color or tag.  
* The bullet journal view highlights high-priority tasks with a unique marker.

### User Story 3: Focus Mode with Sensory-Friendly Design

**As a neurodivergent user sensitive to visual clutter**,

I want to enable a focus mode that simplifies the interface and minimizes distractions so I can concentrate better on my tasks without feeling overwhelmed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* The user can enable focus mode to hide non-essential elements (e.g., sidebars, buttons).  
* The background and task colors adjust to softer, low-contrast tones in focus mode.  
* Notifications and alerts are muted or simplified while in focus mode.

### User Story 4: Recurring and Rolling Tasks

**As a user with executive function challenges**,

I want to set recurring tasks and allow incomplete tasks to roll over to the next day,

So that I don’t feel discouraged if I can’t complete everything in one session.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* The user can mark a task as recurring (daily, weekly, custom).  
* Incomplete tasks automatically carry over to the next day.  
* The app provides a gentle reminder for carried-over tasks without overwhelming the user.

## 5\. Core features: What will your application do?

* **User Control**  
  * User logs in, User profile, preferences in settings page, chooses notification tone preference,   
* **Main Features**  
  * Create to-do list  
  * Set recurring and one-off tasks  
  * Receive notification reminders   
  * 2 AI features:   
- Users have an option between a number of reminder styles by tone and temperament using AI to generate custom messages.  
- Daily summary of the day ahead (as first notification) or a look back on what you accomplished. (many options of this type of notification)  
* **Available Dashboard Views**  
  Kanban view \- with completed, in progress, and to-do list  
  Week at-a-glance  
  Daily 

## 6\. Technical stack: What technologies will you use?

* React (Client)  
  * Node.js (Server)  
  * Tailwind (CSS)  
  * Firebase (Database management & Database Deployment)  
  * Vercel (Web Service Deployment)  
  * Render (Web Service Deployment)  
  * Excalidraw (Wire Frame)  
  * Auth0 (User Authentification)  
  * GPT (AI integration)

## 8\. Team Member Role Assignments

### Primary Role (permanent)

* Project Manager: Juliana  
* Development Operations: Mai  
* User Interface/User Experience: Steph  
* Quality Assessment: Thane  
* Technical Lead: Vanessa

  ### Secondary Role (weekly rotation)

  Taking on a primary role will enable us to delve deeply into a specific position, allowing us to thoroughly develop skills that we can showcase on our resumes and applications. Additionally, rotating through a secondary role on a weekly basis will expose us to all team roles and provide opportunities to collaborate with the lead of our secondary role.   
    
  Each week, we’ll meet with the lead for our assigned secondary role to gain insights into their responsibilities and receive a related ticket to work on. At the end of each sprint, we will evaluate one another during our Kanban board meetings, both through verbal feedback and by creating feedback issues on the board.
